This is a project from the top curriculum you can find it here:

The live version is here:

The task consisted of making the calculator in vanilla HTML and CSS, and all the functionality is made with JS.

I know by doing this that the logic I ended up using is not optimal, but not sure how to really change it. 

I think maybe a better approach would have been to use less variables, and not have my display function do so many things.

 I feel like the logic I ended up using isn't optimal, and I should have stuck to my initial plan which was to store every click into an array and then add it together, but as I found myself struggling more and more, I kind of just started winging solutions and ended up with a lot of spaghetti code. 

 A lot of the functions are doing too much, and when I tried to split them up into smaller sub functions everything would just break, I'm thinking maybe I'll try doing a calculator again someday.
